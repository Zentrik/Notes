\section{Application to Symmetry Groups of Regular Solids}
Let $S$ be a regular solid and $V$ its vertices.
The the symmetries of $S$ are the isometries (distance preseving maps) of $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ that maps $S$ to itself.

\subsection{Tetrahedron (self-dual)}

Let $G$ be group of symmetries of $T$, and $X = \{\text{vertices of } T\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$.
