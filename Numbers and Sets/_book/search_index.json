Proofs A proof is a sequence of true statements without logical gaps, that establishes some conclusion. We havent defined logical gaps etc , we have to start somewhere and have agreed upon assumptions (axioms) We want to prove things because we want to know they are true; We hope to gain insight into why they are true; we might be lucky and the proof is beautiful.

No-one knows if its true. Example 1.2 There are infinitely many primes \\(p\\) s.t. one of \\(p+2,\\ p+ 4,\\ \\ldots,\\ p + 246\\) is also prime. Proved in 2014. Example 1.3 There is always a prime between \\(n\\) and \\(2n\\) for any integer \\(n\\). True however non-obvious. Example 1.4 There is no computer algorithm which will factor an \\(n\\)-digit integer in at most \\(n^3\\) steps Hopefully true. Example 1.5 Every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has a root (in the complex numbers). The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Example 1.6 \\(m \\times n = n \\times m\\) for all integers \\(m,\\ n\\). Worth thinking about  Example 1.7 \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) Does it need proving? 1.2 Some proofs and non-proofs Assertion. For all positive integers \\(n\\), \\(n^3 - n\\) is a multiple of \\(3\\). Try \\(n = 2, 3\\) to check its not obviously false. Proof. For any positive integer \\(n\\), we have \\(n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = n(n + 1)(n - 1) = (n - 1) n (n + 1)\\). One of these consecutive integers \\(n - 1,\\ n,\\ n + 1\\) must be a multiple of \\(3\\), and hence, so must their product. Assertion. For any positive integer \\(n\\), if \\(n^2\\) is even then so is \\(n\\). Proof. Given a positive integer \\(n\\), which is even, we can write \\(n = 2k\\) for some positive integer \\(k\\). Hence, \\(n^2 = (2k)^2 = 2(2k^2)\\), which is even. Nonsense! We wanted to show if A then B but we have shown if B then A. Suppose on the contrary that \\(n\\) is not even. Then \\(n\\) is odd, so \\(n = 2k + 1\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Thus \\[\\begin{align*} n^2 &amp;= (2k+1)^2 \\\\ &amp;= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\\\ &amp;= 4(k^2 + k) + 1, \\end{align*}\\] which is odd, contradicting the assumption that \\(n^2\\) is even.  (contradiction symbol) Proof by contradiction To show that if A then B is true, we showed that there is no case where A is true and B is false. In other words A \\(\\implies\\) B, is the same as showing NOT B \\(\\implies\\) NOT A. Assertion. For any positive integer \\(n\\), if \\(n^2\\) is a multiple of \\(9\\), then so is \\(n\\). This assertion is simply false: e.g. take \\(n = 6\\). To show that if A then B is false, one instance where A is true and B is false is satisfactory. Lecture 2 Assertion. The solution to \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) is \\(x = 2\\) or \\(x = 3\\). This is fact two assertions: \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\) are solutions; there are no other solutions. Proof (i). If \\(x = 2\\) or \\(x = 3\\), then \\(x = 2 = 0\\) or \\(x - 3 = 0\\) so \\((x-2)(x-3) = 0\\) so \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\). Proof (ii). If \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) then \\((x-2)(x-3) = 0\\) so \\(x - 2= 0\\) or \\(x -3 = 0\\) so \\(x = 2\\) or \\(x = 3\\). We could have simplified both proofs into a single one. Proof (Alternative proof). \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;x = 2 \\text{ or } x = 3 \\\\ \\iff &amp;x - 2 = 0 \\text{ or } x - 3 = 0 \\\\ \\iff &amp;(x-2)(x-3) = 0 \\\\ \\iff &amp;x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0. \\end{align*}\\] It is vital that every step is \\(\\iff\\) Assertion. Every positive real is \\(\\geq 1\\) Proof. let \\(r\\) be the least positive integer. Either \\(r = 1\\) or \\(r &lt; 1\\) or \\(r &gt; 1\\) (trichotomy - three different cases) If \\(r &lt; 1\\), then \\(0 &lt; r^2 &lt; r\\), this contradicts the assumption that \\(r\\) is the least positive real. If \\(r &gt; 1\\), then \\(0 &lt; \\sqrt{r} &lt; r\\), again . Hence \\(r = 1\\). Nonsense! We dont know that there is a smallest positive real. Moral: Every claim must be justified 1.3 Combining assertions If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are assertions, we can (but we usually dont) write \\(A \\land B\\) for \\(A\\) AND \\(B\\), \\(A \\lor B\\) for \\(A\\) OR \\(B\\), and \\(\\lnot A\\) for NOT \\(A\\). The truth of these assertions depends on the truth of A and B, summarised in the truth table. \\[\\begin{array}{cc|c} A &amp; B &amp; A \\land B \\\\ \\hline F &amp; F &amp; F \\\\ F &amp; T &amp; F \\\\ T &amp; F &amp; F \\\\ T &amp; T &amp; T \\\\ \\end{array} \\hspace{1cm} \\begin{array}{cc|c} A &amp; B &amp; A \\lor B \\\\ \\hline F &amp; F &amp; F \\\\ F &amp; T &amp; T \\\\ T &amp; F &amp; T \\\\ T &amp; T &amp; T \\\\ \\end{array} \\hspace{1cm} \\begin{array}{c|c} A &amp; \\lnot A \\\\ \\hline T &amp; F \\\\ F &amp; T \\end{array} \\hspace{1cm} \\begin{array}{cc|c} A &amp; B &amp; A \\implies B \\\\ \\hline F &amp; F &amp; T \\\\ F &amp; T &amp; T \\\\ T &amp; F &amp; F \\\\ T &amp; T &amp; T \\\\ \\end{array}\\] Note, for example, that \\(\\lnot (A \\land B)\\) is equivalent to \\((\\lnot A) \\lor (\\lnot B)\\) by comparing truth tables. Also \\(A \\implies B\\) is equivalent to \\((\\lnot A) \\lor B\\) and hence this is equivalent to \\(B \\lor (\\lnot A)\\) (as the or table doesnt depend on the order of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)), and hence to \\((\\lnot B) \\implies (\\lnot A)\\) (follows from the same argument used for \\(A \\implies B\\)). An assertion may involve quantifiers, e.g. \\(\\forall \\; n,\\ \\exists x\\). 1.4 Negating Quantifiers \\(\\lnot (\\forall \\; x \\ \\ A(x))\\)1 means \\(\\exists x \\ \\ \\lnot A(x)\\)2. E.g. if it not true that all my socks are blue, then there is a sock that is not blue. \\(\\lnot (\\exists x \\ B(x))\\)3 means \\(\\forall \\; x \\ \\lnot B(x)\\)4. The order of quantifiers matters! it is false that for all \\(x\\) the assertion \\(A(x)\\) is true there exists an \\(x\\) such that \\(A(x)\\) is false it is false that there exists an \\(x\\) for which \\(B(x)\\) is true for all \\(x\\) \\(B(x)\\) is false "],["elementary-number-theory.html", "2 Elementary Number Theory", " 2 Elementary Number Theory Intuitively, the natural numbers consist of \\(1, 1 + 1, 1+ 1 + 1, \\ldots\\) How do you know you have captured all natural numbers? How do you know they are all distinct? We shall assume: Definition 2.1 (Peano Axioms) The natural numbers, \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), is a set containing a special element \\(1\\) with an operation \\(+1\\) satisfying \\(\\forall \\; n \\in \\mathbb{N},\\ n + 1 \\neq 1\\); \\(\\forall \\; m, n \\in \\mathbb{N},\\ \\text{ if } m \\neq n,\\ \\text{ then } m + 1 \\neq n + 1\\) for any property \\(P(n)\\), if \\(P(1)\\) is true and \\(\\forall \\; n \\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n) \\implies P(n + 1),\\) then \\(P(n)\\) is true for all natural numbers iii is called the induction axiom. i and ii capture the idea that any two natural numbers are distinct; iii captures our intuitive notion that the list5 is complete (i.e. encompasses all natural numbers).6 Now we can write 2 for \\(1 + 1\\), 3 for \\(1 + 1 + 1\\), etc, and we can define an operation \\(+k\\) for any natural number \\(k\\): \\(\\hspace{1cm}\\) for every natural number \\(n\\), we know\\(n + (k + 1) = (n + k) + 1\\); \\(\\hspace{1cm}\\) and so by induction, taking \\(P(k)\\) = \\(+k\\) is defined, proved. Similarly, we can define multiplication, powers, etc. You may check that the normal rules of arithmetic apply: \\[\\begin{align} &amp;1.\\ \\forall \\; a, b, \\in \\mathbb{N} &amp; &amp;a + b = b + a &amp; &amp;(+ \\text{ is commutative}); \\\\ &amp;2.\\ \\forall \\; a, b, \\in \\mathbb{N} &amp; &amp;ab = ba &amp; &amp;(\\times \\text{ is commutative}); \\\\ &amp;3.\\ \\forall \\; a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{N} &amp; &amp;a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c &amp; &amp;(+ \\text{ is associative}); \\\\ &amp;4.\\ \\forall \\; a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{N} &amp; &amp;a (b c) = (a b) c &amp; &amp;(\\times \\text{ is associative}); \\\\ &amp;5.\\ \\forall \\; a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{N} &amp; &amp;a (b + c) = ab + ac &amp; &amp;(\\times \\text{ is distributive over }+); \\end{align}\\] \\(1, 1 + 1, 1+ 1 + 1, \\ldots\\) to see this rigorously, take \\(P(n)\\) = \"\\(n\\) is on this list "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
