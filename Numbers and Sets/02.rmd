# Elementary Number Theory

## The natural numbers

Intuitively, the natural numbers consist of $1, 1 + 1, 1+ 1 + 1, \ldots$

How do you know you have captured all natural numbers? How do you know they are all distinct?

We shall assume:

::: {.definition name="Peano Axioms"}

The natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, is a set containing a special element '$1$' with an operation '$+1$' satisfying

i. $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N},\ n + 1 \neq 1$;
ii. $\forall \; m, n \in \mathbb{N},\ \text{ if } m \neq n,\ \text{ then } m + 1 \neq n + 1$
iii. for any property $P(n)$, if $P(1)$ is true and $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n) \implies P(n + 1),$ then $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers
:::

iii is called the induction axiom.

i and ii capture the idea that any two natural numbers are distinct; iii captures our intuitive notion that the list^[$1, 1 + 1, 1+ 1 + 1, \ldots$] is complete (i.e. encompasses all natural numbers).^[to see this rigorously, take $P(n)$ = "$n$ is on this list]

Now we can write 2 for $1 + 1$, 3 for $1 + 1 + 1$, etc, and we can define an operation '$+k$' for any natural number $k$:
    
$\hspace{1cm}$ for every natural number $n$, we know$n + (k + 1) = (n + k) + 1$;

$\hspace{1cm}$ and so by induction, taking $P(k)$ = "'$+k$' is defined", proved.

Similarly, we can define multiplication, powers, etc. You may check that the "normal" rules of arithmetic apply:

<!--
1. $\forall \; a, b, \in \mathbb{N} \hspace{1cm} a + b = b + a$ [($+$ is commutative);]{style="float:right"}
2. $\forall \; a, b, \in \mathbb{N} \hspace{1.2cm} a b = b a$ ($\times$ is commutative);
3. $\forall \; a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} \hspace{1cm} a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$ ($+$ is associative);
4. $\forall \; a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} \hspace{1cm} a (b c) = (a b) c$ ($\times$ is associative);
4. $\forall \; a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} \hspace{1cm} a (b + c) = ab + ac$ ($\times$ is distributive over $+$); -->

\begin{align}
    &1.\ \forall \; a, b, \in \mathbb{N}  & &a + b = b + a & &(+ \text{ is commutative}); \\
    &2.\ \forall \; a, b, \in \mathbb{N}  & &ab = ba & &(\times \text{ is commutative}); \\
    &3.\ \forall \; a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} & &a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c & &(+ \text{ is associative}); \\
    &4.\ \forall \; a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} & &a (b c) = (a b) c & &(\times \text{ is associative}); \\
    &5.\ \forall \; a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} & &a (b + c) = ab + ac & &(\times \text{ is distributive over }+);
\end{align} 

**Lecture 3**

We can define $a < b$ if $a + c = b$ for some $c \in \mathbb{N}$. You may want to check

\begin{align}
    &6.\ \forall \; a, b, c & a < b &\implies a + c < b + c \\
    &7.\ \forall \; a, b, c & a < b &\implies a c < b c \\
    &8.\ \forall \; a, b, c & a < b \text{ and } b < c &\implies a < c \\
    &9.\ \forall \; a & &\lnot (a < a).
\end{align} 

Recall the induction axiom: if $P(1)$ holds and $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n) \implies P(n+1)$, then $P(n)$ holds $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$.
This is also known as the *(weak) principle of induction (WPI)*. A more useful form is the *Strong Principle of Induction (SPI)*: if

1. $P(1)$ holds and
2. $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $P(m) \;\forall \; m \leq n \implies P(n + 1)$, then $P(n)$ holds $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$.

In fact, WPI and SPI are equivalent. SPI $\implies$ WPI should be fairly clear. To see WPI $\implies$ SPI, apply the former to $Q(n) = `P(m) \; \forall \; m \leq n'$

*Well-ordering Principle (WOP)*: If $P(n)$ holds for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then there is a least $n \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $P(n)$ holds.
An alternative phrasing is "every non-empty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a minimal element".

::: {.theorem}
SPI is equivalent to the WOP.
:::

::: {.proof}
To show that WOP implies SPI, we assume 1 and 2 from SPI, and show that $P(n)$ holds $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$ using WOP.

Suppose, on the contrary, that $P(n)$ is not true $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$.
Then $C = {n \in \mathbb{N}: P(n) \text{ is false}} \neq \emptyset$.
By WOP, $C$ has a minimal element, $m$.
Now $\forall \; k < m$, $k \notin C$ (by minimality of $m$), so $P(k)$ holds $\forall \; k < m$.
But by 2 of SPI, $P(m)$ holds, so contradicting $m \in C$. Hence SPI holds.

To show that SPI implies WOP, suppose there is no least $n \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $P(n)$ holds.
We want to show that $P(n)$ does not hold for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, using SPI.

Consider $Q(n) = `\lnot P(n)'$. 
Certainly $P(1)$ is false (else $1$ would be the minimal element), so $Q(1)$ holds.

Given $n \in \mathbb{N}$, suppose that $Q(k)$ is true $\forall \; k < n$.
Then $P(k)$ is false $\forall \; k < n$.
So $P(n)$ is false as otherwise $n$ would be the minimal element for which $P$ holds.
Hence $Q(n)$ is true, and 2 of SPI holds, so $Q(n)$ is true $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$. 
Thus $P(n)$ is false $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$.
:::

WOP enables us to prove $P(n)$ is true $\forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$ as follows: If not, then there is a minimal counterexample, and we try and derive a contradiction.

## The integers

The integers, written $\mathbb{Z}$, consist of all symbols $n, -n$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $0$.

We can define $+$ and $\times$ etc on $\mathbb{Z}$ using $\mathbb{N}$, and check that the usual rules of arithmetic hold.
We also have
\begin{align*}
    &10.\ \forall \; a \in \mathbb{Z} & a + 0 &= a & &(\text{identity for } +) \\
    &11.\ \forall \; a \in \mathbb{Z}, & \exists \; b \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ s.t. } a + b &= 0 & &(\text{inverses for } + ) \\
\end{align*} 

Define '$a < b$' if $a + c = b$ for some $c \in \mathbb{N}$. Rules 6, 8, 9 continue to hold, but 7 must be modified

7'. $\forall \; a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}, a < b \text{ and } c > 0 \implies ac < bc.$

## The rationals
The rationals, written $\mathbb{Q}$, consist of all expressions $\frac{a}{b}$ (note this is not division as we have not defined division, it just looks the same), where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $b \neq 0$, and $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$ are regarded as the same if $ad = bc$.

Define $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}$, and check it does not matter how we wrote $\frac{a}{b}$ or $\frac{c}{d}$.

We similarly define multiplication, and '$\frac{a}{b} < \frac{c}{d}$' where $b, d > 0$ if $ad < bc$. 
You can check all preceding rules apply.

In addition
\begin{align*}
    &12.\ \forall \; a \in \mathbb{Q},\ a \neq 0,\ \exists \; b \text{ s.t. } ab &= 1 & &(\text{inverses for } \times)
\end{align*} 

*Note*. $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}$.

## Primes
Given $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ we say "$a$ divides $b$" if $\exists \; c \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $b = ac$. We might also say "$a$ is a divisor/ factor of $b$" or "$b$ is a multiple of $a$". We write $a | b$ for $a$ divides $b$.

For any $b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\pm 1$ and $\pm b$ are always factors; all others are called *proper*.

A natural number $n \geq 2$ is *prime* if its only factors are $\pm 1$ and $\pm n$.^[We don't allow $1$ to be a prime as we want to have unique prime factorisations and it would require every statement to say let $n$ be a prime not equal to $1$.]
If $n \geq 2$ is not prime, then it is *composite*.

::: {.proposition}
Every natural number $n \geq 2$
