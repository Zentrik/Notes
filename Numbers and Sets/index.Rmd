## Contents

**Chapter 1.** Elementary (Introductory) Number Theory

- Primes, modular arithmetic. 
- No knowledge will be assumed except the meaning of these terms

**Chapter 2.** The Reals

**Chapter 3.** Sets and functions

- Some important terminilogy will be introduced.

**Chapter 4.** Countability

**Chapter 0.** Proofs

- A proof is a sequence of true statements without logical gaps, that establishes some conclusion.
- We haven't defined logical gaps etc ..., we have to start somewhere and have agreed upon assumptions (axioms)

We want to prove things because 

- we want to know they are true;
- We hope to gain insight into why they are true;
- we might be lucky and the proof is beautiful.
