\section{Alternating groups}

\subsection{Conjugation in alternating groups}
We know that elements in $S_n$ are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type.
However, elements of $A_n$ that are conjugate in $S_n$ are not necessarily conjugate in $A_n$.
Let $g \in A_n$.
Then $C_{A_n}(g) = C_{S_n}(g) \cap A_n$.
There are two possible cases.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If there exists an odd permutation that commutes with $g$, then $2\abs{C_{A_n}(g)} = \abs{C_{S_n}(g)}$.
	      By the orbit-stabiliser theorem, $\abs{\ccl_{A_n}(g)} = \abs{\ccl_{S_n}(g)}$.
	\item If there is no odd permutation that commutes with $g$, we have $\abs{C_{A_n}(g)} = \abs{C_{S_n}(g)}$.
	      Similarly, $2\abs{\ccl_{A_n}(g)} = \abs{\ccl_{S_n}(g)}$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
	For $n = 5$, the product $(1\ 2)(3\ 4)$ commutes with $(1\ 2)$, and $(1\ 2\ 3)$ commutes with $(4\ 5)$.
	Both of these elements are odd.
	So the conjugacy classes of the above inside $S_5$ and $A_5$ are the same.
	However, $(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5)$ does not commute with any odd permutation.
	Indeed, if that were true for some $h$, we would have
	\begin{align*}
		(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5) = h (1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5) h\inv = (h(1)\ h(2)\ h(3)\ h(4)\ h(5))
	\end{align*}
	Hence $h$ must be a 5-cycle so $h \in \genset{g} \leq A_5$.
	So $\abs{\ccl_{A_5}(g)} = \frac{1}{2} \abs{\ccl_{S_5}(g)} = 12$.
	We can then show that $A_5$ has conjugacy classes of size $1, 15, 20, 12, 12$.

	If $H \trianglelefteq A_5$, $H$ is a union of conjugacy classes so $\abs{H}$ must be a sum of the sizes of the above conjugacy classes.
	By Lagrange's theorem, $\abs{H}$ must divide 60.
	We can check explicitly that this is not possible unless $\abs{H} = 1$ or $\abs{H} = 60$.
	Hence $A_5$ is simple.
\end{example}

\subsection{Simplicity of alternating groups}
\begin{lemma}
	$A_n$ is generated by 3-cycles.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Each $\sigma \in A_n$ is a product of an even number of transpositions.
	It therefore suffices to show that a product of any two transpositions can be written as a product of 3-cycles.
	For $a, b, c, d$ distinct,
	\begin{align*}
		(a\ b)(c\ d) = (a\ c\ b)(a\ c\ d);\quad (a\ b)(b\ c) = (a\ b\ c)
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
	If $n \geq 5$, all 3-cycles in $A_n$ are conjugate (in $A_n$).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We claim that every 3-cycle is conjugate to $(1\ 2\ 3)$.
	If $(a\ b\ c)$ is a 3-cycle, we have $(a\ b\ c) = \sigma(1\ 2\ 3)\sigma\inv$ for some $\sigma \in S_n$.
	If $\sigma \in A_n$, then the proof is finished.
	Otherwise, $\sigma \mapsto \sigma(4\ 5) \in A_n$ suffices, since $(4\ 5)$ commutes with $(1\ 2\ 3)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
	$A_n$ is simple for $n \geq 5$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $1 \neq N \triangleleft A_n$.
	To disprove normality, it suffices to show that $N$ contains a 3-cycle by the lemmas above, since the normality of $N$ would imply $N$ contains all 3-cycles and hence all elements of $A_n$.

	Let $1 \neq \sigma \in N$, writing $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Suppose $\sigma$ contains a cycle of length $r \geq 4$.
		      Without loss of generality, let $\sigma = (1\ 2\ 3\dots r) \tau$ where $\tau$ fixes $1, \dots, r$.
		      Now, let $\delta = (1\ 2\ 3)$.
		      We have
		      \begin{align*}
			      \underbrace{\sigma\inv}_{\in N} \underbrace{\delta\inv \sigma \delta}_{\in N} = (r \dots 2\ 1) \tau\inv (1\ 3\ 2)(1\ 2\dots r) \tau (1\ 2\ 3)= (2\ 3\ r)
		      \end{align*}
		      So $N$ contains a 3-cycle.
		\item Suppose $\sigma$ contains two 3-cycles, which can be written without loss of generality as $(1\ 2\ 3)(4\ 5\ 6) \tau$.
		      Let $\delta = (1\ 2\ 4)$, and then
		      \begin{align*}
			      \sigma\inv \delta\inv \sigma \delta = (1\ 3\ 2)(4\ 6\ 5)(1\ 4\ 2)(1\ 2\ 3)(4\ 5\ 6)(1\ 2\ 4) = (1\ 2\ 4\ 3\ 6)
		      \end{align*}
		      Therefore, there exists an element of $N$ which contains a cycle of length $5 \geq 4$.
		      This reduces the problem to case (i).
		\item Finally, suppose $\sigma$ contains two 2-cycles, which will be written $(1\ 2)(3\ 4)\tau$.
		      Then let $\delta = (1\ 2\ 3)$ and
		      \begin{align*}
			      \sigma\inv \delta\inv \sigma \delta = \underbracket{(1\ 2)(3\ 4)(1\ 3\ 2)(1\ 2)(3\ 4)}_{(2\ 4\ 1)} (1\ 2\ 3) = (1\ 4)(2\ 3) = \pi
		      \end{align*}
		      Let $\varepsilon = (2\ 3\ 5)$.
		      Then
		      \begin{align*}
			      \underbrace{\pi\inv}_{\in N} \underbrace{\varepsilon\inv \pi \varepsilon}_{\in N} = (1\ 4)(2\ 3)(2\ 5\ 3)(1\ 4)(2\ 3)(2\ 3\ 5) = (2\ 5\ 3)
		      \end{align*}
		      Thus $N$ contains a 3-cycle.
	\end{enumerate}
	There are now three remaining cases, where $\sigma$ is a transposition, a 3-cycle, or a transposition composed with a 3-cycle.
	Note that the remaining cases containing transpositions cannot be elements of $A_n$.
	If $\sigma$ is a 3-cycle, we already know $A_n$ contains a 3-cycle, namely $\sigma$ itself.
\end{proof}
