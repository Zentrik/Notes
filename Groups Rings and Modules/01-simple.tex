\section{Simple groups}

\subsection{Introduction}
If $K \trianglelefteq G$, then studying the groups $K$ and $\faktor{G}{K}$ give information about $G$ itself.
This approach is available only if $G$ has nontrivial normal subgroups.
It therefore makes sense to study groups with no normal subgroups, since they cannot be decomposed into simpler structures in this way.

\begin{definition}[Simple Group]
	A group $G$ is \vocab{simple} if $\qty{1}$ and $G$ are its only normal subgroups.
\end{definition}

By convention, we do not consider the trivial group to be a simple group.
This is analogous to the fact that we do not consider one to be a prime.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:1.3}
	Let $G$ be an abelian group.
	$G$ is simple iff $G \cong C_p$ for some prime $p$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Certainly $C_p$ is simple by Lagrange's theorem.
	Conversely, since $G$ is abelian, all subgroups are normal.
	Let $1 \neq g \in G$.
	Then $\genset g \trianglelefteq G$.
	Hence $\genset g = G$ by simplicity.
	If $G$ is infinite, then $G \cong \mathbb Z$, which is not a simple group; $2\mathbb Z \triangleleft \mathbb Z$.
	Hence $G$ is finite, so $G \cong C_{o(g)}$.
	If $o(g) = mn$ for $m, n \neq 1, p$, then $\genset{g^m} \leq G$, contradicting simplicity.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:1.4}
	If $G$ is a finite group, then $G$ has a \vocab{composition series}
	\begin{align*}
		1 \cong G_0 \triangleleft G_1 \triangleleft \dots \triangleleft G_n = G
	\end{align*}
	where each quotient $\faktor{G_{i+1}}{G_i}$ is simple.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
	It is not the case that necessarily $G_i$ be normal in $G_{i+k}$ for $k \geq 2$.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
	We will consider an inductive step on $\abs{G}$.
	If $\abs{G} = 1$, then trivially $G = 1$.
	Conversely, if $\abs{G} > 1$, let $G_{n-1}$ be a normal subgroup of largest possible order not equal to $\abs{G}$.
	Then, $\faktor{G}{G_{n-1}}$ exists, and is simple by the correspondence theorem.
\end{proof}
