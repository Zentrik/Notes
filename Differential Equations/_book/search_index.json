Example 0.1 (Newton's 2nd law) \\[\\begin{align*} m \\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = F \\end{align*}\\] If \\(F\\) depends only on \\(t\\), then we can simply integrate twice. However, if \\(F\\) is a function of \\(x\\) (such as a charged particle in a electric field which varied over space). Applied course - emphasises methods and results rather than proof or existence. 0.3 Limits Informally, if \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} f(x) = A\\), then \\(f(Px)\\) can be made arbitrarily close to \\(A\\) by making \\(x\\) sufficiently close to \\(x_0\\) Note, does not require \\(f(x_0)\\) to equal \\(A\\) (or even to exist)  a limit is a statement about the behaviour of a function in the vicinity of \\(x_0\\), but not at that point. More formally, for a function \\(f(x)\\) defined on some open interval containing \\(x_0\\) (but not necessarily at \\(x_0\\)), \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} f(x) = A\\) means that for any \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(\\delta &gt;0\\) such that \\(|f(x) - A| &lt; \\epsilon\\) for all \\(0 &lt; |x - x_0| &lt; \\delta\\). Right hand limit, for example, defined similarly but with \\(0 &lt; |x - x_0| &lt; \\delta\\) replaced with \\(0 &lt; x - x_0 &lt; \\delta\\). A similar procedure can be done for left hand Limits Figure 0.1: Right hand limit We can also define limits at infinity, e.g.Â \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} f(x) = A\\) means that for any \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(X &gt;0\\) such that \\(|f(x) - A| &lt; \\epsilon\\) for all \\(x &gt; X\\). 0.3.1 Properties if \\(f(x)\\) has a limit at a point, it is unique If \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} f(x) = A\\) and \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} g(x) = B\\), then: \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} [f(x) + g(x)] = A + B\\) \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} [f(x)g(x)] = AB\\) \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} [f(x) / g(x)] = A / B\\). If \\(B = 0\\), the limit of the quotient does not exist if \\(A \\neq 0\\), but may exist in the indeterminate case \\(A = B = 0\\) These properties will be proved carefully in the Analysis 1 course next term, but will be used as without proof in this course. 0.3.2 Proof of uniqueness of limits Suppose that \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} f(x) = A\\) and \\(\\lim_{x \\to x_0} f(x) = B\\). In terms of our epsilon-delta definition, this means that for any \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\)h there exists \\(\\delta_A &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\delta_B &gt; 0\\) such that \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\text{for }0 &lt; |x -x_0| &lt; \\delta_A,\\ |f(x) - A| &lt; \\epsilon / 2 \\text{, where } \\epsilon / 2 \\text{ is an arbitrary positive quantity.} \\\\ \\color{red}{and} &amp;\\text{ for } 0 &lt; |x -x_0| &lt; \\delta_A, |f(x) - B| &lt; \\epsilon / 2 \\end{align*}\\] Now let \\(\\delta = min(\\delta_A, \\delta_B)\\) and consider \\(0 &lt; |x -x_0| &lt; \\delta\\) - follows that \\[\\begin{align*} |A - B| &amp;= |[A - f(x)] - [B - f(x)]| \\\\ &amp;\\leq |A - f(x)| + |B - f(x)| \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\epsilon \\end{align*}\\] Since this holds for all \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), we must have \\(A = B\\).
